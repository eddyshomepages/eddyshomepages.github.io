## Welcome to the renewed website! 

As the title suggests, this site has been completely renewed. Previously, the site had been built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and then moved to [Github](https://github.com). Now the site has been completely rebuilt using [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and at the same time the structure of the site has been made simpler. 

In the future, all [blog](#posts) posts will be written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format in a text file and stored in a directory, from where it will then be converted into a visible format on the site. 

The site has been updated with the ability to change the theme between "light" and "dark" modes, as well as the ability to choose either English or Finnish among the language settings. At the moment, however, the old [blog posts](#posts) have not yet been translated into English, but little by little, this is also the intention.

This website renewal is also a direct continuation of my desire to learn programming and programming languages ​​such as [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and thus also to create great websites. And in my opinion, this renewed website is very successful.

Welcome back to explore and read old articles that have been moved to this renewed website.
