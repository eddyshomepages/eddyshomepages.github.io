The history of the site begins in the summer of 2022, when the first articles were published. This original site was created with [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/) and ran on an [OrangePi+](https://linux-sunxi.org/Xunlong_Orange_Pi_Plus) minicomputer. The operating system in the background was [Armbian Linux](https://www.armbian.com/) and the web server was [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)-webserver. Initially, the site's URL was [https://fasted.dy.fi](https://fasted.dy.fi), to which traffic was directed using the [dy.fi](https://www.dy.fi/) Finnish dynamic DNS service. 

The site seemed to be slowly gaining more and more visitors and it was up and running for a little over two years. Due to the increasing usage (and because the site was running at my home) I decided to move it to a different server. At this point, the site was created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which can generate [static web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) and at the same time the site was moved to [Github](https://github.com/), which can host static web pages. At this point, the site address changed to [https://eddyshomepages.github.io](https://eddyshomepages.github.io) before changing to its current form [https://eddyshomepages.fi](https://eddyshomepages.fi) in the summer of 2025.

Former version of the site was created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and it was in use for about a couple of years until it was completely revamped to look like the current one. During this period, there were no new posts on the site, mainly due to my own busy schedule and the fact that I didn't really have time to write stories.

During these past couple of years, I have been trying to study programming alongside my work, focusing on [Full stack](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack_js.asp) programming, and as a result, these updated pages were actually created. My [Full stack](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack_js.asp) programming focuses on [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [React.js](https://react.dev/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) databases. I have also become somewhat familiar with the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.

In relation to this [Full stack](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack_js.asp) programming, I have made various web-based applications such as a house consumption monitoring including heat, water and electricity consumption monitoring, car cost monitoring (fuel, maintenance, driving diary) and various other applications. In addition, I have learned to retrieve information from [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application Programming Interface) interfaces, such as traffic information, weather information and fuel price information. In addition, I have made some work-related applications using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and also other applications and made application packages for Linux from these applications such as [AppImage](https://appimage.org/)-, [deb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format))- and [rpm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager)-packages. I admit that I have had to use some artificial intelligence to help with difficult matters, or so-called [vibecoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding).

Coming back to this renewed site, this site has been implemented as a so-called [Single Page App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) or SPA and this new site has been created using [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS). All stories and writings are saved as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) documents in the server directory, from where they are then parsed into this format as they appear on the site. And since the site is located on [Github](https://github.com/), things and stories can be updated/added using git commands. 

This new version of this website was launched on September 14, 2025, and you are browsing this updated website.
