## Welcome to my homepages!

These home and blog pages have been created using the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) webserver running on top of the Raspberry Pi 2 and the [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) blog platform. [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) webserver is lightweight and allows you to automatically get a certificate for your website via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). In addition, the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) webserver automatically keeps the certificate up to date. 

The intention is to start writing various posts related to home automation, Linux and other things on these pages. In addition, these pages serve as a learning environment for WordPress for me and possibly also as some kind of part-time job in the future.
