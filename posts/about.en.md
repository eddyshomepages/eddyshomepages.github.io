The site administrator is a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) "nerd" who likes to tinker with Linux and other related stuff in his free time like [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) small computers. In addition, all things related to home automation are also close to my heart. I have a background in civil engineering and almost 25 years of work experience in various positions in the construction and real estate industry, e.g. as a project manager in various renovation and energy efficiency projects.

Now, however, I have changed fields and at the beginning of February 2022, I started studying for a vocational qualification in information and communication technology, specialising in welfare technology. I completed this degree in about 1.5 years and received my papers in October 2023. I also started at Samma in August 2023 in my current profession as a technical support person. In this job, I use my own Linux operating system, which suits me more than well, because now I get to deal with things that I have been doing for the last twenty years on a daily basis.

On this site, I still intend to write various [blog](.) posts related to my own experiences that I have accumulated over the years, e.g. with [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). For example, the creation of this website started from the desire and enthusiasm to learn how to set up and maintain your own blog site. My previous blog pages ran on the [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) platform, which was also something I wanted to learn to use from the beginning at the time. I maintained these pages for almost a year before they were changed to the current one.

These current pages are hosted on [Github](https://github.com) using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site generator. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) can be used to create static websites, which are of course a bit more laborious to maintain, but on the other hand, their operation is faster and more secure, because the pages are static and you cannot log in to the site in the same way as you would on a [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) server. However, the idea of maintaining the sites has not changed from before, because I still intend to continue writing about these personal experiences while this site and these writings serve as a checklist for myself of the installations I have made, if and when I need to go back to an old installation later.

Maybe these are as useful to someone else as they have been to me when I've been looking for solutions to problems online and reading various discussion forums etc. other people's writings. However, as a reminder, always remember to take backups before you start making major changes to your system. These writings are based on personal experiences and are ones that I have done myself through trial and sometimes also by mistake and that have worked for me. These things do not necessarily work on your system or computer, so I do not take responsibility if something happens to you with your own system or computer because you have acted according to these writings of mine.

You can send me a message or questions via social media links or the comment field. Commenting is done using [utterances](https://utteranc.es/), which is very much in line with [GitHub](https://github.com), where these sites are also placed.
